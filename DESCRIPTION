Description: Local partial likelihood estimation by Fan, Lin and Zhou(2006)<doi:10.1214/009053605000000796> and simultaneous confidence band is a set of tools to test the covariates-biomarker interaction for survival data. Test for the covariates-biomarker interaction using the bootstrap method and the asymptotic method with simultaneous confidence band (Liu, Jiang and Chen (2015)<doi:10.1002/sim.6563>).
